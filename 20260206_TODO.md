Analyse the current state of the project/repo and:

1. thoroughly review the base_edge_node_amd64_gpu/ image definition
1.1. verify if anything can be optimized or updated to align with the latest best practices in GPU image construction, especially regarding CUDA and TensorRT versions,the media stack and crytography/web3 dependencies.
1.2. ensure that the image includes all necessary dependencies for the intended workloads while minimizing unnecessary
1.3. Ensure that the image is optimized also for size and build time, potentially by leveraging multi-stage builds or more efficient base images.

2. thoroughly review the base_edge_node_amd64_cpu/ image definition
2.1. verify if anything can be optimized or updated to align with the latest best practices in CPU image construction, especially regarding Python, Torch, onnx, openvino versions, the media stack and crytography/web3 dependencies.
2.2. ensure that the image includes all necessary dependencies for the intended workloads while minimizing unnecessary
2.3. Ensure that the image is optimized also for size and build time, potentially by leveraging multi-stage builds or more efficient base images.

3. Review .github/workflows/base_edge_node_amd64_cpu.yaml.paused and .github/workflows/base_edge_node_amd64_gpu.yaml.paused that are currently ".paused" and determine what needs to be done to unpause them

4. Review the build-and-push-* scripts that are used for manual build and push and determine if they can be optimized and further aligned with the .github/workflows/* definitions 


Do not make any changes to the repo but rather create PLAN.md with a detailed plan of action for the review and optimization process, including specific areas to focus on, tools to use for analysis, and criteria for evaluating potential changes. The plan will be used by another Agent to execute the review and optimization process effectively. Include in the action plan mandatory addition of thorough and detailed commenting of each stage in the Dockerfiles to explain the purpose and reasoning behind each step, which will aid in future maintenance and onboarding of new team members.
